Attempt at the 3rd-person / FPS capsule character controller operating within the physics world.

It is mostly based on Poke Dev's [Collide And Slide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR6Q7dUz2uk) video. Still a work in progress. At the moment it is a bit glitchy with the character frustratingly getting stuck on wall ends or in grooves.
